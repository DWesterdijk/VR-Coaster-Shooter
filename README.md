# VR Coaster Shooter

In this project I wanted to fiddle around with VR, and on rail movement. So I decided to make a VR Coaster shooter.

## Features

- VR Control
- On-Rail movement
- Bullet travel physics

## Software Analysis 
Unreal Engine: It is suitable for VR, fast and as quite some supporting plugins for VR. It is also fairly easy to use even with a small understanding of c++ thanks to their blueprint system. But UE is not suitable for small projects and solo projects, thus I will not be using this engine since this is a small solo project.

Unity Engine: Unity is good for 2D and 3D rendering, and in this case I would need 3D rendering. It has a build in VR support and makes the scene ready for VR. Unity is also really easy to use for new beginners, you only need a good understanding of the c# language. Once you have that understanding Unity will be a good option to use, also since it is really suitable for solo developers.

HTML/JS: It is also possible to make this project using HTML and JS, there are quite a few plugins and tools that make it possible for to make a VR or AR project, depends on what you want. but since HTML and JS aren't my favoured languages to work in I will avoid using this.

The reason I choose Unity Engine is mainly because my general knowledge of c# is better than other languages, and Unity is my most used engine currently, thus the easiest for me to find my way in it. Unity is also good for rendering 3D and VR, and has good beginner support, which I may need with exploring VR.

## Goals 
- VR camera movement and control.
- On Rail movement.

## Planning 

| | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|week 1 | I will start my research in Unity VR and setup the scene in Unity. | I will make a begin where I will make the VR work. | I will make the onrail movement and make it possible to shoot stuff. | I will fine tune the VR a bit if needed, and else I will start making targets. | Once the targets are done I will start on making an easy point system.
|week 2 |
